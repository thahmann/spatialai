## An Ontology Design Pattern for Spatial and Temporal Aggregate Data (STAD)

The STAD Ontology Design Pattern models concepts required for defining spatial and temporally aggregated data in a precise manner. It is aimed at providing baselines for data integration decision-making and permitting provenance of aggregate quantities. 

#### Overview
The ontology describes four characteristics that we have identified as essential for capturing the semantics of spatial temporal aggregates: spatial support (where), temporal support (when and, more precisely, how long and how frequently), base quantity (what), and transformation method (how) based on whether a quantity is aggregated spatially, temporally or spatio-temporary. As seen in image gelow, only spatiotemporal aggregates require all four characteristics, while only temporally aggregated data requires no spatial support and only spatially aggregated data requires no temporal support.
